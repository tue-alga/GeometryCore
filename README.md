GeometryCore is a java library to quickly develop prototypes for geometric 
algorithms and tools. 

It has five primary foci: (1) stand-alone and portable;
(2) basic geometric objects in 2D; (3) easily set up a basic GUI; (4) ease of
importing from and exporting to IPE files; (5) abstraction from rendering code
between GUI and file formats.
    
Refer to the Wiki pages on GitHub for more details and basic tutorials.
